# Step 1 : Collecting data
- In this step we are going to collect data of different character names in different Witcher books.
- We are going to use Selenium for extracting data from the website
- Selenium is the most popularly used freeware and open source automation tool. The benefits of Selenium for **Test Automation** are immense.
- The website from which data is collected: [https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki)

  ## End result of Step 1

  - The end result of this step is a csv file or a pickle file that will store the characters data
  - The data collected is stored in data-frame which have two columns
  - One column will store the name of book and the other column will store the character name

# Step 2 : Extracting Relationships
- In this step we are to find the relationships between different characters in the book
- Then we have to find the importance of characters in each book
- Then we’ll find the communities present in each book
- And at last we’ll find the importance of top characters over time in books
